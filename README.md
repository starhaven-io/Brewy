- Mac App Store integration via [`mas`](https://github.com/mas-cli/mas) (browse installed apps, check for updates)
- Manage Homebrew services (start, stop, restart)
- Organize packages into custom groups
- Action history with retry support for failed commands
- Manage taps (add/remove third-party repositories) with health monitoring for archived, moved, and missing taps
- Run `brew doctor`, remove orphaned packages, and clear the download cache with dry-run previews
- Menu bar extra showing outdated package count
- Configurable auto-refresh interval and brew path
- Light, dark, and system theme support
